## System Architecture

**Frontend Architecture**: The website is built as a single-page static HTML application with embedded CSS and JavaScript. This approach was chosen for its simplicity, fast loading times, and ease of deployment without requiring server-side processing.

**Styling Approach**: The design uses vanilla CSS with modern techniques including CSS Grid, Flexbox, and CSS custom properties (variables). A mobile-first responsive design approach ensures optimal viewing across all device types. The styling is embedded directly in the HTML file for minimal HTTP requests.

**Component Structure**: The layout follows a traditional business website structure with distinct sections including navigation, hero area, services, about, and contact information. The design emphasizes clean, professional aesthetics suitable for an automotive business.

**Navigation System**: Fixed navigation bar with smooth scrolling between sections provides seamless user experience. The navigation uses CSS transforms and transitions for visual feedback.

**Performance Optimization**: Single-file architecture minimizes HTTP requests, while optimized images and efficient CSS ensure fast loading times. The design prioritizes Core Web Vitals for better search engine performance.

## External Dependencies

**Font Awesome**: Integrated via CDN (version 6.4.0) for consistent iconography throughout the site. This provides professional-looking icons for services, contact information, and visual elements without custom icon development.

**Google Fonts**: Uses system fonts (Segoe UI, Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana) as fallbacks to ensure consistent typography across different operating systems while maintaining fast loading times.

**No Backend Dependencies**: The website operates as a static site with no server-side processing, database connections, or dynamic content management requirements.
